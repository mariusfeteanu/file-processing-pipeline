File Processing Pipeline-

We would like you to create a python process to pick up two flat files (excel and csv), validate them and to produce output files.

Original File
Parquet File
(Error file – if applicable)

You will need to produce a series of input files which will test the logic in your python package. For example, a file containing character codes within a decimal field will produce an error file. The error file is to contain the reason for failure and the field and row on which it occurred.

For the CSV File

Create a file having 10 fields each with the following types:-

- 7 Decimal fields (28,8) – any value is allowed (negative and positive)
- 1 Country field (ISO standard) – create a lookup file
- 1 Currency field (ISO standard) – create a lookup file
- 1 Company field (make up a list of dummy companies – must have grave accent codes ).
  You will need to create a lookup file. Containing source id, central company id and company name
- Make the company, currency, country and one decimal field mandatory.

For Excel

Create two worksheets one containing the 10 fields specified above and the other the list of lookup codes (company, currency and country)


Provide processing files that cover a small number of records for both the csv and excel.
In addition for the csv a file containing a large number of records (up to ½ million)

Validation & Check which needs to be done

- Validate data types
- Validate Country against a list
- Validate currency against a list
- Validate company against your lookup file using the company source id from you dummy data. Append the central company id to the output file.
